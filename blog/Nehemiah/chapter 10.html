            Israel binds itself with an oath of a curse to follow the decrees of the Lord (vs29). They were very determined no matter the cost. This happened because of the pain they passed through in exile Babylon. God herd their cry and returned them to Jerusalem and rebuilt the walls through Nehemiah, so they made every effort to follow His decrees.
            In verse 34, they casted lots to determine which family is going to bring firewood to the altar of God. The interesting part is the lots which they casted. This clears the confusion in some Christians that whether voting is wright or wrong, we also see this when Matthias was selected to replace Judas in Acts 1vs26.
